Calculator Project

This is an ongoing project to develop a fully functional calculator application using C Programming Language.
The goal is to create a user-friendly and feature-rich calculator that can perform various mathematical operations.

Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, etc.)
- Support for multiple number systems (decimal, binary, hexadecimal)
- User-friendly interface with input validation

Current Status

The project is currently in the development phase, with the following features implemented:

- Basic arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/, square root, square of numbers)

Future Plans

- Implement advanced mathematical functions
- Add support for multiple number systems
- Enhance user interface with additional features (history, memory, etc.)
